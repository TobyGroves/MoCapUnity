# MoCapUnity

Motion capture unity project to use with the MoCapPi repo running on a raspberry p

all of the number crunching and processing is done within unity. 

Once the unity version is working I will endevour to create a thing using TEFGAS (my engine) to show the live data so that the suit could be used with other things like MAYA and whatever else it might be useful for.
